# DiscordRPCForUnity
This is a Discord Rich Presence Plugin for Unity Engine. 

âš  **Disclaimer:** This package is known to have some bugs and has not been tested to work with newer versions of Unity (above 2019). Use at your own risk.

Follow these simple steps to set everything up correctly:

1. Drag the 'DiscordRPCForUnity' unity package file into Unity or click on Assets > Import Package > Custom Package... and choose the downloaded unity package.
2. Click Window > Discord RPC to open the Editor Window. Do not close this window, otherwise it won't work correctly. You can dock it where you want.
3. Your console should print "Initializing Discord RPC..." and "Successfully initialized Discord RPC.".
   If you get an error, please contact me. I do not recommend changing ANYTHING inside the folders as it will cause issues.
4. And that's it! You can now open Discord and it will say "Playing Unity Editor".


Features:
- Shows project name
- Shows active scene
- Shows timestamp
- Shows Editor version


You can disable console logging if you want, simply click on SHOW MORE and then TURN OFF.
If you are using PlayerPrefs, don't name your key '$DISCORD_RICH_PRESENCE_SHOULD_LOG_MESSAGES_INT$' as it will conflict with the plugin.
